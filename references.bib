abstract = {The objective of this review was to summarize the expected yield gains of black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.), jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.), white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) and red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.), to correct provenance-progeny selection, first generational selection strategies and second generational selection strategies, based on a systematic assessment of the scientific literature. The procedure consisted of four sequential steps: (1) searching electronic databases for relevant forest tree improvement studies employing a meta-analytical protocol; (2) attaining and assessing the identified publications for their specific applicability; (3) collating the results of the resultant study subset in terms of relative height growth gains; and (4) estimating rotational consequences in terms of merchantable productivity via prediction models. The results of the systematic search indicated that documented long-term yield responses to tree improvement were paucity in nature. Specifically, the majority of the published studies consisted of short-term results pertaining to provenance-progeny experiments. Furthermore, studies reporting yield responses to first and second generational selection strategies were practically non-existent. Consequently, expert opinion and unpublished preliminary results derived from ongoing tree improvement experiments were used to augment the limited published information available for these selection strategies. Overall, the results indicated that correct provenance-progeny selection could yield juvenile height growth gains of approximately 15% at 15 years for black spruce, 7% at 21 years for jack pine, 12% at 20 years for white spruce and 8% at 15 years for red pine. Corresponding merchantable productivity (mean annual merchantable volume increment) gains at rotation (50 years) for plantations established at nominal initial densities on medium-to-good quality sites were approximately 17, 15, 26 and 7%, respectively. Preliminary estimates derived from individual case-studies indicated that (1) first generational selection strategies could increase merchantable productivity by approximately 13% at 50 years for black spruce, 28% at 40 years for jack pine, and 20% at 45 years for white spruce, and (2) second generational selection strategies could increase merchantable productivity by approximately 31% at 50 years for black spruce.}

Tests were made to determine the extent to which estimates of the model parameters were affected by differences in planting density ranging from 150 to 1,200 per acre at each of two forests. Results indicated no consistent relationship between any of the estimated parameters and planting density at either of the two forests. Differences such as did exist between individual height-age curves at a given location were ascribed to minor site quality differences rather than differences in planting density. The shape of the curves at the two locations was judged to be sufficiently similar for the development of an anamorphic site index equation. Forest Sci. 30:1059-1066.}",

title={Breeding program and strategy for white spruce in Quebec},

abstract={This information report presents the strategy for the genetic improvement of white spruce (Picea glauca [Moench] Voss) set up in Quebec by the Canadian Forest Service. A brief overview of the land ownership in Quebec and of the context in which the breeding program was initiated and developed is set out. Furthermore, from the report, one can see that the breeding strategy is based on material developed and genetic information acquired over many decades. As the Canadian Forest Service moves away from the management of the white spruce breeding program, this report will be essential for technology transfer.  Ce rapport d'information présente la stratégie d'amélioration génétique de l'épinette blanche (Picea glauca [Moench] Voss) mise en place au Québec par le Service canadien des forêts. On y fait un bref survol du régime de propriété existant au Québec et du contexte dans lequel le programme d'amélioration a été initié et poursuivi. De plus, on pourra constater au cours de la lecture de ce rapport que la stratégie d'amélioration s'appuie sur du matériel génétique divers et sur des connaissances de la génétique de l'espèce acquises au cours de plusieurs décennies. Le Service canadien des forêts délaissant la direction du programme d'amélioration, ce document se veut aussi un moyen privilégié de transfert de technologie.},

title={Meta-Modelling to Quantify Yields of White Spruce and Hybrid Spruce Provenances in the Canadian Boreal Forest},

journal={Forests},

volume={11},

number={6},

pages={609},

abstract={Tree improvement programs can improve forest management by increasing timber yields in some areas, thereby facilitating conservation of other forest lands. In this study, we used a meta-analytic approach to quantify yields of alternative white (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) and hybrid spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry ex Engelmann x Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) stocks across planting sites in the boreal and hemiboreal forests of Canada. We extracted meta-data from published tree improvement program results for five Canadian provinces covering 38 planting sites and 330 white and hybrid spruce provenances. Using these meta-data and a random-coefficients nonlinear mixed-effects modelling approach, we modelled average height over time trajectories for varying planting site characteristics, as well as climate transfer distances between planting sites and provenances. Climatic transfer distances had strong effects on the height trajectory parameters. In particular, the asymptote parameter had a nonlinear increasing trend with planting site versus provenance mean annual temperature differences. We incorporated the height trajectory meta-analysis model into an existing growth and yield model to predict volume yields. Overall, this research provides a mechanism to quantify yields of alternative provenances at a particular planting site, as a component of decision support models for evaluating evaluate forest management investment into improved planting stocks alternatives under current and possible future climates.},
